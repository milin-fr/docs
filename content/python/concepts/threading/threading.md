The `threading` module allows multiple threads of execution to take place in a Python program.

While threads may appear to run simultaneously, only one thread can be executed at a time. This is enforced by Python's [global interpreter lock](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-global-interpreter-lock).

Threading is helpful when working with tasks that are I/O bound. This includes web-oriented tasks like scraping or downloading files.

## Syntax

```pseudo
import threading
```

The `threading` module must first be imported before thread constants can be created and their methods can be used.

## Example

This example prints out some messages from both the main thread and separate threads:

```py
import threading
import time
import random

def slow_function(thread_index):
    time.sleep(random.randint(1, 10))  # simulates waiting time, for example an API call response
    print("Thread {} done!".format(thread_index))

def run_threads():
    threads = []
    for thread_index in range(5):
        individual_thread = threading.Thread(target=slow_function, args=(thread_index,))
        threads.append(individual_thread)
        individual_thread.start()
    # at this point threads are running independently from the main flow of application and each other 
    print("Main flow of application")
    for individual_thread in threads:
        individual_thread.join()
    # joining threads insures that all threads are done before moving further in the main flow of application
    print("All threads are done")

run_threads()

```

This results in output like the following:

```shell
Main flow of application
Thread 4 done!
Thread 1 done!
Thread 2 done!
Thread 0 done!
Thread 3 done!
All threads are done
```
